<h4> RavenR: tool for Raven Hydrological Modelling Framework </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> An R software package 
  for pre- and post-processing of Raven input and output. It includes a wide range of tools for hydrologic analysis.
  Even with very little knowledge of R, you can put together a simple workflow script to run the model and 
  produce visual output or initially set up a Raven model by importing meteorological and streamflow data.<br/>

<h4> Raven Hydrological Modelling Framework </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Raven is a robust and flexible hydrological modelling framework, designed for application to challenging hydrological problems in academia and practice. Raven is developed by the Raven Development Team, led by <a href = "http://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/jrcraig/">Dr. James R. Craig</a>.
This fully object-oriented code provides complete flexibility in spatial discretization, interpolation, process representation, and forcing function generation. 
The Raven project is also free and open source software, and is actively used in both academia and practice.<br/>
