  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href = "http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> 
    at the University of Waterloo. My research is focused on hydrologic modelling, advised by 
    <a href = "http://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/jrcraig/">James R. Craig</a> and 
    <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/btolson/home">Bryan Tolson</a>. My research is supported by the 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/awards/engineering-excellence-masters-and-doctoral-fellowships-eemf">Engineering Excellence Doctoral Fellowship</a> through the Engineering Faculty, among other sources. My Master of Applied Science thesis was, "Rigorous Validation of Hydrologic Models in Support of Decision-Making", and can be found on 
the <a href = "https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/12470">UWSpace</a> repository.
<br/>
<br/>
I am a licensed as Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) with <a href = "https://peo.on.ca/directory">Professional Engineers Ontario</a>, and worked full-time in consulting as a Water Resources Engineer prior to beginning my PhD studies. I have also launched a company, <a href="https://heronhydrologic.ca/">Heron Hydrologic</a>, which specializes in hydrologic modelling services and training through professional courses.

The martial arts are a big part of my life. I practice and teach karate at <a href = "https://www.legacymartialartsandfitness.com/">Legacy Martial Arts and Fitness</a> in Kitchener, where I have been a member for over 21 years and hold a 4th degree black belt.
